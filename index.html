        <h2>A Haiku I Wrote</h2>
        <p>My passion for motorsports:<br>
			Engines roar, heart soars<br>
			Freedom in the shifting gears<br>
			Thrill worth all the toil<br>

        <h2>Personal interests</h2>
		<p class="indented">Something that I find fascinating is motorsports. 
		I got into this when I was 10 years old, riding my dirt bike. 
		This passion has stayed with me throughout my life. The sound 
		of the motor, shifting gears, and being in control all gave me 
		a sense of freedom to be myself. You also learn to take care of 
		your equipment, as dirt bikes require a lot of maintenance. When 
		you do your part, the bike does its part.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indented">I mention dirt bikes primarily because that’s where 
		I started and what got me into motorsports. However, since then, I’ve ridden 
		various exciting vehicles such as four-wheelers, UTVs, jet skis, 
		stand-up jet skis, and boats. I even enjoy towing long distances. 
		Engaging in these activities brings me happiness, and I believe 
		everyone should experience them at some point. The adrenaline from 
		these motorsports is incredible. Although it requires a lot of work 
		to get started, the thrill of the moment makes it all worth it.</p>
